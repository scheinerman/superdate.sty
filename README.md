superdate.sty
=============

We provide the LaTeX style file `superdate.sty` to make fancy dates in
the format `YYYY:MM:DD:hh:mm` where `YYYY` is a 4-digit year, `MM` is
a 2-digit month, `DD` is a 2-digit day, `hh` is a 2-digit hour (from
00 to 23), and `mm` is a 2-digit minute. Leading zeros are kept so
there are always 12 digits and four separators (colons, but this can
be changed). 

Please see the file `superdate.pdf` for more information. Examining
the `superdate.tex` file is also illustrative.
